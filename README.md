# Wordle Analysis

Welcome to my world of wordle!

Wordle has recently been taking the world by storm, as this seemingly simple game challenges users to think creatively. Have you ever wondered why some people tend to guess words faster and more consistently? The secret is all in the distribution.

Using Python, I found the frequency of letters for the words officially recognized by Wordle. The most common letters are S, E, A, O, and R, while the least common are Q, J, X, Z, and V. 

Based on these frequencies, your 'best' first guess would likely be one of the following: SOARE, ROATE, SALET, REAST, or RAISE, as the chance that the solution does not contain any of these letters is exceedingly rare.
If you have no interest in winning or simply enjoy a challenge, feel free try words such as QAJAQ, IMMIX, or JAZZY!
